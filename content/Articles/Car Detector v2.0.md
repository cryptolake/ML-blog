# Car Detector v2.0: Let's focus on ML

# What is Car Detector v2.0?

Car Detector 2.0 is successor to my end of year project with my team, this time i added the features that i didn't know how to implement with many improvement.

# Let’s Delve Deeper

Here's a breakdown of the tech used:

Yolos: a transformer based yolo implementation that boasts both great performance, small size and ease of fine tuning
Huggingface: a platform that makes accessing pretrained for inference or fine tuning very easy through the use of multiple python libraries
Fastai: An ai library that acts as a wrapper around ML libraries to eliminate boilerplate code
Fastapi: An api framework in python that is very performant, uses latest features of python (type hints and class models) and easy to use

Overview of the new features developed:

- Multi car extraction
- More information including probability and top predictions
- double the accuracy
- Better inference performance
- smaller memory footprint

# What made this challenging?

I had to understand my previous code and re-do most of it, this is one of the most common exercises
done by software engineers, i redefined the class that handles the prediction and add dataclasses
to verify the data from the models which also create a good layer to serilization and visualization.

# Next up!

In my next project i will delving into LLMs and especially local llms and ways to be able to "talk"
to your projects or have a personal assistant over your notes and files!

# Finishing up
